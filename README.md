# 📘 Learn_Android: Practical Android UI/UX Samples

Hi there! I'm **Prashant Gohel** — an aspiring **Android Learner** and **DevOps Enthusiast**, and this repository is my personal collection of clean, modern, and reusable **Android UI/UX samples**. 

🎯 The goal is to **learn by building small focused projects**, and share them with others who are on the same journey.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Each folder in this repo is a **self-contained Android mini project** focused on a specific UI pattern, animation, or component. You can open any folder independently and run it as a full Android Studio project.

Current structure:

```
Learn_Android/
│
├── LogoDrawSplash/      ← Animated vector splash screen (Instagram-style)
├── ToolbarExample/      ← Custom Toolbar with radius and shadow
├── ...more coming soon!
```

---

## 📦 What You’ll Learn

These mini projects cover:

- 🎨 Material UI Design Patterns  
- ✨ Vector & Path Animations  
- 🧭 Navigation & Toolbar Tricks  
- 🔘 Custom Buttons, Loaders, Cards  
- 📱 Fullscreen & Transparent UI  
- 🛠️ Clean Code, Easy Integration

## 📦 Download a Specific Folder Only?

GitHub doesn’t support downloading individual folders via UI or Git, but you can use **SVN export**:

```bash
svn export https://github.com/prashantgohel321/Learn_Android/trunk/LogoDrawSplash
```

> Replace `LogoDrawSplash` with any folder name you want  
> Requires `svn` installed (e.g., `sudo apt install subversion` on Linux)
